<p>In product development, the interaction can include:
— technical information related to the design and implementation of the cybersecurity strategies
or countermeasures for the E/E-system in order to determine potential impacts on the technical
safety concept and the system design;
— cybersecurity software and hardware design considerations in order to determine potential impacts
on the achievement of the software and hardware safety requirements and design constraints such
as independence;
— functional safety can provide information related to design and implementation of safety measures
in order to communicate functional safety constraints that can be relevant to cybersecurity;
— safety and cybersecurity analysis activities can be harmonized in order to uncover potential
cybersecurity impacts on functional safety. Safety analyses can also consider the impact of
cybersecurity strategies and countermeasures; and
— cybersecurity countermeasures identified to address systematic failures in order to determine the
potential impacts on functional safety, for example, methods required for the development of safety
measures that are shared with cybersecurity.</p>
